## getopts

In Bash, the getopts is a built-in command that helps you parse command-line options and arguments in a script. It allows you to define options and specify their behavior when the script is invoked.

The syntax of the getopts command is as follows:

bash
Copy code
getopts optstring variable [args]
optstring is a string containing the option characters that your script supports. If a character is followed by a colon (```:```) in optstring, it indicates that the option requires an argument.
variable is the name of the variable that will store the currently parsed option.
args is an optional variable name that will store the remaining command-line arguments after all options have been processed.
When you invoke the script, you can pass options and their arguments as command-line arguments. The getopts command can be used within a loop to iterate over each option and argument.

Here's a simple example to demonstrate the usage of getopts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while getopts ":a:b:" opt; do
  case $opt in
    a)
      echo "Option -a with argument $OPTARG"
      ;;
    b)
      echo "Option -b with argument $OPTARG"
      ;;
    \?)
      echo "Invalid option: -$OPTARG"
      ;;
  esac
done

shift $((OPTIND - 1))
echo "Remaining arguments: $@"
```
In this example, we define two options ```-a``` and ```-b``` using optstring in the getopts command. Within the loop, we use a case statement to handle each option accordingly. If an option requires an argument, it can be accessed using the ```$OPTARG``` variable.

After the loop, the shift command is used to shift the command-line arguments, excluding the parsed options, so that you can access any remaining arguments using ```$@```.

By using getopts, you can create more flexible and robust Bash scripts that accept various options and arguments from the command line.
